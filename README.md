# Kleverchain Snap (beta)

This is the official snap for Kleverchain. This snap acts as a interface between the Kleverchain JS SDK and Metamask.

## Packages
There are two packages in this repository:
  - `site`: Is an front-end example that uses the snap. Its main purpose is to provide quick UI actions to test the snap.
  - `snap`: Is the snap itself.

You can find more information about each package in their respective README.md files.
